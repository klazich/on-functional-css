                Css and Scalability<br>
                <small class="fw4 gray">by Adam Morse</small>
            </h1>
            <p id="first-p" class="lh-copy mv4 f4 fw3 black-80">
                Several years ago I got curious about how css worked at scale. When I first started
                out, there weren’t nearly as many learning resources as there are
                now. There were a few books that my friends lent me and a couple
                of decent blog posts. But css was still pretty new and most people
                hadn't started to think deeply or learn hard lessons about concepts
                of maintainability when working with teams on large web apps.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-copy mv4 f4 fw3 black-80">
                Css zen garden was a highly influential demo 'back in the day.' Most of my colleagues
                and I thought this did a perfect job at illustrating the power of
                the cascade. You could drastically alter a site's visual design without
                touching even a bit of html.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-copy mv4 f4 fw3 black-80">
                In the beginning, that’s what people sold me as a feature. By writing css, you could
                make a change in one place and have it propagate everywhere. In principle
                this sounds highly desirable. But eleven years later, my experience
                on both large and small teams is that this is the most terrifying
                thing about css and can cripple an organizations ability to iterate
                on their product.

                After countless implementations of css systems that broke down and became difficult
                to maintain as apps and teams grew larger...I've found I want little
                to no part of the cascade's 'features.'

                I used to joke that the worst part about front-end development was that the other
                people solving your problems were front-end developers. But in the
                past few years a lot of very smart people have been thinking more
                about css and this has lead to some fascinating discussions around
                how to build ‘scalable’ ui and how that relates to css. When I first
                started to think about scalability I naturally started to read every
                blog post and watch every tech talk I could get my hands on. There
                are a number of suggested 'best practices' around how sass/less/stylus
                etc. will help you build maintainable css. How mixins can make your
                code more DRY. How extends will keep your markup clean and pretty
                to look at. How BEM will make your code so perfect you want to cry.

                But what is reality? What actually gets shipped to production? What do all of these

                When it comes to designing and shipping products I like to think about reality. Which
                can be challenging sometimes. I’ve sat in too many meetings where
                people don't want to hear or talk about reality. They talk in empty
                phrases about hypothetical possibilities. I like to do drugs and
                talk like that too sometimes. But, if you don't accurately assess
                where you currently are and what your reality is, it can be pretty
                tough to figure out what your problems are. And the chance of finding
                solutions to unidentified problems is, well, not good.

                So there I was, in the fall of 2014, a new employee at an
                <a title="sfdc dot com" href="http://salesforce.com" class="link black underline">award winning tech company</a> that had a website. And that website
                had a lot of css. Wanting to familiarize myself with the codebase
                - I opened up dev tools and started to read the site's css.

                I saw this class and thought - well at least you know what it does. Unlike some of
                the other css it seemed like it was very reusable. By anyone who
                needed to float something left.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-copy mv4 f4 fw3 black-80">
                I kept reading and stumbled across this:</p>
            <pre class="">

.left-only-scr1 {

                I found myself wondering what the story was behind this next code block. Is it for
                elements with the class .header-nav-list that aren’t nested inside
                an element with the class .header-nav-container?

                Css is interesting because unlike other types of code, you are most likely to find
                the most recent code towards the bottom of the file. Reading a css
                file from start to finish will often times reveal in chronological
                order how a defined system breaks down.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-copy mv4 f4 fw3 black-80">
                In the above examples we see things breaking down to increasingly longer selectors
                that have more and more weight that were only setting one property
                to one value: float: left.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-copy mv4 f4 fw3 black-80">
                Mind you, there are only three options for float. Contrary to one of the code examples
                above, there is no float center. Just left, right, and none.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-copy mv4 f4 fw3 black-80">
                Reading the css made me think about a lot of things. One thing I couldn’t get out
                of my head was - why all this work to change one thing? Why write
                all that code to just float something left?
            </p>
            <p class="lh-copy mv4 f4 fw3 black-80">
                To me, this is a reflection of the mental model most people are in when they are
                writing front-end code. They are generally trying to change one or
                two things in an interface and that’s it. And when you are in this
                mode of development you want to limit the amount of things you break
                - while also making the change that is being asked for in some jira
                ticket that got assigned to you.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-copy mv4 f4 fw3 black-80">
                I also started to think about communication and how it moves in multiple directions.
                If I’m reading html, I want to know what the css is going to do.
                If I’m reading css I want to know what will happen if I apply it
                to a block of html. In a great system there is a two way street of
                information. If you look at the css, you can tell what will happen.
                If you look at the html, you know what the code will do.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-copy mv4 f4 fw3 black-80">
                But most front-end systems are not great. You have what I refer to as one-way streets
                of information. If I am looking at a block of html and I can’t find
                ALL of the css that will visually affect how it renders in under
                5 seconds, I feel that system is failing. So if I ran into the above
                example:
            </p>
            <code>
                .container-inner.promo-status
            </code>
            <p class="lh-copy mv4 f4 fw3 black-80">
                That means I would have to find elements that had both of those classes (but not
                limited to) on an element. But by looking at this block of css I
                also have no idea if it has been redefined elsewhere. So I must grep
                through the system to find definitions for container-inner and promo-status.
                By the time I found those definitions - I would probably have forgotten
                what I was trying to do in which case I’d leave my desk and go get
                coffee.
            </p>

            <p class="lh-copy mv4 f4 fw3 black-80">
                On the flip side think about this example:
            </p>
            <pre>
<code>.red {
  color: #FF4136;
}</code>
</pre>

            <p class="lh-copy mv4 f4 fw3 black-80">
                I’d presume that this would make an element have red text. I was traditionally told
                this is a horrible name for a class. But I quite like it. The only
                way I’d think it was bad is if it set the color property to: purple,
                blue, or any other color that wasn’t red. Or if it was mutated a
                few times to a few different shades of red. But more on that later.
            </p>

            <p class="lh-copy mv4 f4 fw3 black-80">And if I saw this block of html:</p>
            <pre>
<code>&lt;div class=“red”&gt;Some text&lt;/div&gt;</code>
</pre>
            <p class="lh-copy mv4 f4 fw3 black-80">
                I’d know without looking at the css what was going to happen. This is what I call
                a two-way street of information. It’s easy to learn a group of small
                classes that do one thing well and can be reused in any context.
                There should be a one to one mapping between a class and it’s definition.
                Having a class that has multiple definitions be being redefined depending
                on context doesn’t solve problems, it creates them. The concept of
                immutability is not new - but we’ve ignored it in the css community
                for far too long. Imagine if you had a function called ‘filesize’
                where you passed it a filename and it returned the filesize. That
                sounds pretty great. But imagine if sometimes it returned the amount
                of lines in the file. That doesn’t sound great at all does it. Well
                that’s what you’re doing anytime you redefine a css class. It’s the
                worst for people who are good at debugging css. It’s even more horrible
                for people new to the cascade.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-copy mv4 f4 fw3 black-80">
                When we look at convoluted css, we must remember that behind every css ruleset is
                a story. Maybe the author was on a time crunch and didn’t have time
                to look up if there was some previously written code they could reuse.
                Maybe they don’t care about css at all and the second something works
                they save, commit, and go back to writing monads. When I write bad
                code, it isn’t because I’m not trying to write good code. There are
                always other forces at work. What are the forces that work against
                writing clean reusable code? How do we get rid of them? I’ve spent
                the last few years doing a lot of user testing centered around how
                people write their own front-end code, consume other peoples front-end
                code, and think about developing UI in general. It has been a pretty
                valuable experience (as user-testing generally is). I’ve learned
                a lot about the different mental models people use - and how to try
                to construct systems that allow people of all abilities to spend
                more time designing / building and less time debugging/fighting/crying.

                <i>(I don’t know where to fit this in)</i>
                <br> Before I started doing both performance and user testing I did not
                like the idea of oocss/atomic css. I really liked writing monolithic
                classes and traversing the dom with my selectors. It made a ton of
                sense to me and I was able to build out a lot of websites that way.
                Running tests and testing my assumptions helped inform a lot of how
                I think about code now. I’m not very interested in what I can do
                with css. I’m interested at this point in what I can help groups
                of people do with css.

            <p class="lh-copy mv4 f4 fw3 black-80">
                If you’re going to build a new component, or change a piece of UI in your app - what
                do you do? I don’t know anyone that reads all the available css in
                the app to see if there is something they can reuse. Who has time
                to read thousands of lines of code before they start working!? Even
                if people do have the time, I have not found that this is their first
                instinct on how to get going. I don’t blame them.

            <p class="lh-copy mv4 f4 fw3 black-80">
                Even if you did read all of the available css and stumbled upon some code that you
                think might be reusable - what if someone edits it later? If you
                are starting from the assumption that your css isn't reusable, your
                first instinct is to write new css. But most likely you aren't creating
                a new classification of visual styles. In my experience it is likely
                that you are replicating visual styles that already exist.

                Salesforce may pay people a lot of money. And they may win Forbes awards for being
                the most innovative. But they are not known for hiring people who
                are great at css. Their css is anything but innovative. After reading
                all of the css and going through bits of crying, head-scratching,
                and laughing out loud - I determined that this problem must only
                exist at Salesforce. Surely awesome companies like Medium, GitHub,
                Adobe, and Pinterest didn’t have this problem. They’ve hired some
                of the most amazing css developers I’ve ever met. They must have
                figured out how to scale css.

                was.
            </p>

            <p class="lh-copy mv4 f4 fw3 black-80">I found the exact same things.</p>

            <p class="lh-copy mv4 f4 fw3 black-80">Let’s take a look at just the rulesets that set things to display none:</p>

            <ul class="list lh-copy pl0 mt0">
                <li>
                    <a class="link underline dim black" href="https://gist.github.com/mrmrs/786241f0a5fade0324e2"

                        title="Pinterest">Pinterest</a>

            </ul>
            <p class="lh-copy mv4 f4 fw3 black-80">
                That’s a lot of code setting things to display: none. If you look at the files above
                ask yourself some questions: Do they seem like they follow the principles
                behind DRY? Does this seem like a bunch of code you would know how
                to reuse?
            </p>
            <p class="lh-copy mv4 f4 fw3 black-80">
                If I’m going to write css, I want it to be reusable. If someone isn’t going to reuse
                it - it seems pretty useless.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-copy mv4 f4 fw3 black-80">
                So what does DRY even mean? Because you do have to repeat yourself somewhere! You
                either repeat yourself in html or in css. But no matter how good
                you are at css - you can’t build out a new component without editing
                html. But, it is possible to build a new component without writing
                a single line of css. And this applies to changing UI too. You should
                be able to change most things, just by editing html.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-copy mv4 f4 fw3 black-80">
                When you repeat yourself in html, there isn’t any real damage to file size (read:
                multi-class patterns will not bloat your html). A user doesn’t have
                to download every html file from your website to view one page. Yet
                most web sites are architected in a way that require you to download
                the css for the entire site when you try to view one page. This is
                a broken model.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-copy mv4 f4 fw3 black-80">
                The files I referenced above are the result of css authors generating really long
                selectors that add a lot of weight to your cascade to do one or two
                things. And as time goes on there are more and more things in your
                cascade to override. So your selectors get longer and longer, your
                file sizes get bigger and bigger, and the amount of time you spend
                debugging css is going to go up and up and up.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-copy mv4 f4 fw3 black-80">
                In this model, you will never stop writing css. Refactoring css is hard and time
                consuming. Deleting unused css is hard and time consuming. And more
                often than not - it’s not work people are excited to do. So what
                happens? People keep writing more and more css.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-copy mv4 f4 fw3 black-80">
                This affects scalability in two ways. One, it makes it harder to work on your app
                because you can't realistically memorize all of the css in your app.
                And if it isn't internalized it isn't likely to be reused. It also
                means that your users have an increasing amount of code to download.
                And if you think “oh but it will never get that bad, gzip will save
                the day” - well you’re wrong. Pinterest has more than 1mb of uncompressed
                css spread out over 5 files. Once gzipped it is still a whopping
                159kb.
                <b>That is a lot of css</b>. 97% of it isn’t used on the homepage. I’d
                rather just try and send my users the 3% they do need.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-copy mv4 f4 fw3 black-80">
                Part of this code bloat is an attachment to authoring ‘content-semantic’ class names.
                Honestly I’m surprised you can find people that still think this
                isn’t the worst idea ever.

                    Nicolas Gallagher already wrote the mic drop piece on why this doesn’t work.</a>
                But for some reason you still find people arguing for its merits as a silver bullet
                solution. Personally I think most of the internet is unnecessarily
                broken. So I assume everything we have been taught is most likely
                wrong.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-copy mv4 f4 fw3 black-80">
                This is where we come to the crux of the problem I have with any system that requires
                you to map visual styles to components in your css. Content semantics
                have
                <b class="fw4 ttu">nothing to do with visual styles</b>. When I used to build things
                with legos I never thought ‘oh this is a piece for an engine block’
                I thought ‘oh cool this is a 1x4 blue lego and I can do anything
                I want with it’. It didn't matter if I was building an underwater
                aquanauts base or an airplane - I knew exactly how to use that lego
                block.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-copy mv4 f4 fw3 black-80">
                It’s all about lego bits. Because I never needed to re-contextualize my understanding
                of lego blocks. I could use them across ‘projects’ and they were
                always the same. I dream of this world in front-end development.
                I want lego blocks that work everywhere because there is serious
                power in leveraging solutions that are project agnostic.

            <p class="lh-copy mv4 f4 fw3 black-80">
                Outside of some brand specific background-images, gradients, and colors etc., the
                overwhelming majority of css you would need for your site has already
                been written. Yet we continue as a community to constantly reinvent
                the wheel. Which is starting to feel like building a camera from
                scratch every time you want to take a photo. I totally think building
                cameras from scratch is cool and a worthwhile endeavor. But I don’t
                want to do it every time I am going to take a photo. I just want
                to go take photos.

            <p class="lh-copy mv4 f4 fw3 black-80">
                When I read about or listen to ideas on how to scale an app’s css - most of the talk
                is about how to write css. The real way to scale css, is to stop
                writing css. Abstract out the things you use most and move to a multi-class
                pattern where you compose visual patterns in your html. You might
                be amazed at how quickly your team starts to move.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-copy mv4 f4 fw3 black-80">
                There are a lot of problems that come along with people writing css. Inconsistent
                values, the introduction of magic numbers, duplicate code, non-responsive
                patterns. I’m sure there are others.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-copy mv4 f4 fw3 black-80">
                If you create a system that is flexible and powerful, and pull from that, you might
                find your designs to be more harmonious. You might spend less time
                debugging the cascade. Your pages will probably load faster. But
                who knows. Maybe that won’t work for you at all. All I know is the
                current model is definitely not going to work.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-copy mv4 f4 fw3 black-80">
                Writing new css should be the exception, not the rule.

            <h3>Parting Thoughts</h3>
            <p class="lh-copy mv4 f4 fw3 black-80">
                If you have never read your outputted css from start to finish - I recommend it as
                an amazing way to learn a lot about css and how people use it. After
                I read salesforce’s css I started reading css in entirety for many
                sites. I still do this! I learn something new every time.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-copy mv4 f4 fw3 black-80">
                Don’t take this as dogma. The real point of this whole piece is to encourage you
                to go test your assumptions. Not many people sit with other people
                building UI and just *observe* how they build out new features or
                refactor old ones. User-testing is such a great exercise to learn
                about how people use things. You can learn a lot from people who
                are great at writing front-end code and also people who are brand
                new to it. I wouldn’t have learned much of this if I just sat around
                and tried to solve problems by myself or read all the latest hip
                blog posts. The reality is lots of people with varying levels of
                agency will touch your front-end code and you should design a system
                that works for everyone.

                Thank you to everyone who has given me feedback on these thoughts over the last few

                challenge existing best practices and gave me the courage to do the
                same. I'm looking at you
